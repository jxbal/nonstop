Project Proposal Feedback
Project: PlanIt
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
Nice work here, a very complete description in the first paragraph, and a
good justification for the project in the second paragraph.  There are quite
a few calendar applications 'out there' so you'll need to find things about
your application to stress to make it seem truly different.

A couple of questions arise:
   1. What makes this application REALLY different from something like
      Doodle or Calendly or YouCanBookMe?
   2. There is a LOT here ~ are there some parts that you can designate
      as 'more important' so that you can prioritize and 'de-scope' some
      things that may need to be put on the product backlog?
   3. Are there any security issues with updating across other peoples'
      calendars?  I'm thinking back to when Facebook's 3rd party company
      got exploited ~ what will you do to provide security as that 3rd
      party application?
   4. Will users have a choice for calendar sync'ing?  Will it be opt-in
      or opt-out?

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
Nice work on the presentation from all three of you.  I like that you all
participated and knew which part was assigned to whom.  One thing to give
a little more focus is in the Q&A portion.  Try to let everyone answer
questions so you appear as a cohesive team.


Summary:
--------
Total: 5% out of %5 for this deliverable.

Very nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.
