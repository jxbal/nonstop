======================

SUMMARY:
   Excellent synopsis of the article, you got all the main points!

CRITICAL THINKING:
   Relation to S/W engineering:
      You nailed the point about interacting with the larger 'ecosystem' of
      the device's operation, and how weakness can be exploited at any level
      of operation.  I like your reference to "secure coding practices"!

   Thoughts/opinions presented:
      I agree, it is 'eye-opening' to find out these facts ~ even a bit
      scary.  Your closing is a good call for everyone to be aware.

      Nice work!
