Documentation Feedback ~ Deliverable #3
Software Development Plan
CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

INTRODUCTION/DELIVERABLES SECTION:
   The introduction is perfect!
   The deliverables section needs to add the tasks for your project so that
      they are specifically accounted for.  NOT the schedule, just the tasks
      and brief descriptions.

PROJECT RESOURCES SECTION:
   Excellent job here, nothing to add.

PROJECT ORGANIZATION SECTION:
   Excellent job here, nothing to add.

PROJECT SCHEDULE SECTION:
   The link to the second document is a good way to access the schedule.  I
      also like the way you have laid it out as a bullet list rather than
      a Gantt chart here.  You also did a PERT chart, which is admirable ~
      not many people choose that option since it's not linear.
   Excellent job here, nothing to add.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Project Deliverables               0.5
   Project Resources                  1.0
   Project Organization               1.0
   Project Schedule                   2.0
                                     =====
   Subtotal                           4.5
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage: 4.5/5 = 90% which is an A-minus

Add those tasks into the deliverables section by the end of the semester for
full credit on this document.

Nice job!
