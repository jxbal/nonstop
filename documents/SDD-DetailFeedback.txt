DATABASE DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION:
      This really should be an "Entity-Relationship Diagram" or "ERD".  However
      since we are close to the end of the semester, I'm not going to make you
      do this part again.  The verbal descriptions are pretty good, since you
      talk about what the entities [tables] will be.
