Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Excellent job on this section, as well as with the introduction.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Since you are doing a waterfall-style document, you'll need to be a wee
   bit more specific in your requirements language.  For example, you have:

      3.1.1.1 The login page shall log users into the app.

   This is a good start, but omits what the user must do/see to accomplish
   the task.  A more specific way of doing this is:

      3.1.1.1 The login page shall provide users with a labeled text entering
              field for entering a user name.
      3.1.1.2 The login page shall provide users with a labeled text entering
              field for entering a password.
      3.1.1.3 The login page shall provide users with a labeled button which
              will cause the two entry fields to be read by the application.
      3.1.1.4 The login page shall send the user data to the backend CSU for
              credential verification.

   This is the level of detail at which the development team can actually
   begin to code the appication's parts.

Make sure you add the two missing sections and do a few updates to the
functional requirements section by the end of the semester for full credit
on this document.
