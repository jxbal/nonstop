Project Proposal: PlanIt <br/>
Owen Dewing, Kelly Tao, Juan Ballesteros <br/>

Project Description: <br/>
For our project, we have decided to build a mobile-based scheduling app to facilitate group projects, weekend hangouts, family reunions, and more. Currently, existing scheduling programs include manual calendar applications and Zoom scheduling. This application will allow users to import calendars from other applications or input manual times, highlighting available times for groups to meet/hang out. The software required includes React for frontend, C#, and .NET for backend, in addition to Firebase for authentication and various calendar APIS. <br/>

Project Justification: <br/>
We believe that this project exemplifies knowledge from throughout our CMSI courses, such as multiple languages, web/mobile development, authentication work (Firebase), and more. Some languages highlighted will be C#, React, and .NET. The project at an overall view looks doable, but more complex features will possibly take more than one semester, depending on time and effort. Overall, we believe the project tackles an existing problem that many students/families/friends/etc. have struggled with at least once in their lifetime. <br/>

Some features we want to implement:
- Group scheduling
- Import existing calendars (Google, Outlook, Apple, etc.)
- Specific availability button (highliting the times everyone has free)
- Ability to join multiple groups
- Reminders (reminding users 15-30 minutes before an event)
- Location Integration
- Voting System/Suggestions/Recommendations for future events
- Time zone support: automatically adjust for users in different time zones
- Mark certain times as preferred (set priority)
- Calendar themes
- Set group event as recurring (ex: game night), and automatically populate next coming weeks
- Auto-sync calendars from google, apple, etc so users donâ€™t have to update it in the app
- Allow users to set up polls to vote on future events when there is free time
