Project Description: <br/>
For our project, we have decided to build a mobile-based scheduling app to facilitate group projects, weekend hangouts, family reunions and more. 

- Group scheduling
- Import existing calendars (Google, Outlook, Apple, etc.)
- Form different groups
- Specific availability button
- Multiple groups
- Reminders
- Location Integration
- Voting System/Suggestions/Recommendations
- React/Mobile App
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Time zone support: automatically adjust for users in different time zones
- Use AI to predict (based on past) when users will be busy
- Mark certain times as preferred (set priority)
- Calendar themes
- Set group event as recurring (ex: game night), and automatically populate next coming weeks
- Auto-sync calendars from google, apple, etc so users donâ€™t have to update it in the app
- Allow users to set up polls to vote on future events when there is free time
